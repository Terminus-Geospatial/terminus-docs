Building the underlying Jupyter-Book

## Preconditions

I am still adjusting to the MacOS switch from `bash` to `zsh`, so forgive any types and please report them. 

### Installing Jupyter-Book

####  Installation on MacOS (M2, Sonoma)

Make sure you are using the Homebrew latest Python, since Apple tends to be stingy...

    $> which python3
    /opt/homebrew/bin/python3

    $> python3 --version
    Python 3.11.6

Run the install instructions (via pip) using the normal procedures [link](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/start/overview.html#install-jupyter-book)

    $> pip3 install -U jupyter-book
